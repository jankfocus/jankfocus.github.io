I'm `jankfocus` and this is my vanity blog.
This is a place for me to wax poetic about whatever crosses my mind.
Topics include but are not limited to:
* math
* theoretical computer science
* systems programming
* programming language design
* game design, especially TTRPGs and TCGs
* music
Assume no consistency in posting schedule, topic, tone, or style.
This is for me, not for you.
